</dl>
<dl>
<strong><dt>4.How much will my additional pension cost?</dt></strong>
<dd>- The cost is calculated using a number of factors such as your age and
the amount of additional pension you want to buy.

increase or decrease depending upon the results of the valuation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<strong><dt>6.Can I continue payments if I am on unpaid leave or leave the
scheme?</dt></strong>
<dd>- No, you may only make payments while contributing to the scheme.We
will calculate how much additional pension you are entitled to receive based
upon the contributions you have paid up to the day you leave the scheme.
You can, however make a one off lump sum payment to clear the outstanding
contributions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<strong><dt>7.Will the contributions alter if I start to work parttime?</dt></strong>

you did when you worked full-time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<strong><dt>8.If I decide to draw part of my pension before my Normal
Pension Age (NPA), can I receive my additional pension too?</dt></strong>
<dd>- Yes, provided you have paid for it in full, but the pension will be subject
to an actuarial reduction.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<strong><dt>9.What happens if I retire before the end of a payment
period?</dt></strong>
